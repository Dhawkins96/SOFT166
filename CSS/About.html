            <!-- brief about me -->
            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'll Start off with saying "Hello", I'm Daisy and like you saw from the Home Page this is my website where I will be uploading all my University work.
                I honestly never thought I would go to university, I thought my time of full-time education had already passed me by (23 and already one foot in the grave I know). <br/>
                The only reason I thought it was never an option was because I already had a full-time and the idea that I wouldn't have steady paycheck coming in terrified me.
                I thought it was a pipe dream because I didn't decide that I wanted to go to university at school (I ad no idea what I wanted to do with the rest of my life) and in all honesty I didn't think I was smart enough. <br/>
                I can now say I was a very stupid lady, I have already achieved a foundation year in Computing, I can confidently code in multiple language, and I finally know what I want to do with my life and my career in the future!
                I am very proud of how far I have come and even though I know I still have a long way to go, I know I will succeed because I've seen what life is like when you don't enjoy or are passionate about what you do.
            </p>
            <!-- brief about the project-->
            <h1 class="w3-text-teal">About This Project</h1>
            <p>
                This project was to design a Password Strength Checker and integrate them with the Hue lights in SMB 109. If you haven't already looked at the Project the link is in the side bar to the left.
                Within the Password Strength Checker it changes automatically when you type anything in the password text-box. This then scores you to see if you have a strong password based on what you have typed so if you have a capital letter,
                a number, a special character and the length. This score gets put into a progress bar and goes up as you type in the relevant information and a set of checkboxes are listed underneath
                showing what you need to get the strongest passwords. While all of this is happening the Hue lights are also changing depending on the strength of the password, if you are ever unsure about what a colour means
                you can click on the Light Key Index in the Password Strength Checker which explains all the colours and how strong the password is. <br/>
                I hope you enjoy!
