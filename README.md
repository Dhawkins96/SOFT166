# SOFT166 Website 
#### Assignment

Hello and welcome to my SOFT166 project website.

Here I created a Password Strength Checker which has Phillips Hue Lights integrated in and they change colour depending on the password you type in. The website also contains;
* Main Page Index
* Light Key Index
* About Page

Here are a few images from the website
![Main Page](https://github.com/Dhawkins96/SOFT166/blob/master/Main%20Index.png)
This is the main website index. Here you can see;
* 2 images of myself
* A small opening paragraph
* A small map (Location set to my university)
* Then your normal NavBar and SideBar

Within the NavBar you will be able to then go to the About page or in the SideBar you can go on to the Password Strength Checker

This is the Password Strength Checker, from here you can see;
* The same NavBar and SideBar
* Here the SideBar has a Light Key Index instead of a Password Strength Checker
* You can also see that the textbox to input the password - this also changes colour depending on the password strength
* A show Password checkbox - as the password with be hidden unless ticked
* A progression bar to show how strong the password is 
* Checkboxes underneath which get ticked off as you enter their variable
* A small paragraph explaining what the Key Light Index is and where to find it

Next you have the Light Key Index, this page is a simple one. This just explains which of the Phillip Hue Light colour mean what and what the textbox colour also means depending on the strength of the password. As you can see Blue in the Hue Lights means that the password is very poor but the Green in the Hue Lights means its very strong.

You can also only get to the Light Key Index when you are on the Password Strength Checker as you would only need it then.

Finally in my last picture is of my About page. This page just gives a little over view of myself and underneath that it gives a brief paragraph about the project in general. As you can see I have also left in the 2 pictures from the Main Page Index.

### How To Use the Website?

I feel that this website is very easy to navigate but never-the-less, the first page you will see would be the Main Index Page. This page is quite open and if you want to move between the pages you just must select one of the pages above in the NavBar or SideBar. These pages are only going to be either the Password Strength Checker or the About Page as if you click "Daisy Hawkins" that will refresh the Main Index Page. 

For now, let’s assume you click on the Password Strength Checker, from here you can see the application. All you must do is type in the textbox next to "Enter Password:", this then start checking every key you type in automatically, so you don’t have to click any enter buttons. The password in the textbox will be automatically hidden but just underneath there is a checkbox which you can tick to see the password you have typed in or untick to hide it again. As you type in a password the strength bar underneath will either increase or decrease (depending on what you type in) and the checkboxes will tick as you fill out a requirement such as including a number or special character. On the right of the screen you will also see a small paragraph explaining if where to find the Phillips Hue Light information and what every colour means in terms of the Password Strength Checker. 

That’s all you need to know for the Password Strength Checker but if the user did want to click on the Light Key Index, they would be taken to the page which just shows a table on what each colour means and its relationship with how strong the password is. Once they were done and wanted to go back all they would have to do is click on the Password Strength Checker in the SideBar. 

The Final page I haven't explained yet is just the About page and it the same as both the Main Page Index and the Light Key Index as its very simple and you don't have to click on anything unless to move to another webpage to move to. Here you can just read the about paragraphs about myself and the project together and after that you would understand every page.

### Testing of Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)

When testing the accessibility of my website I tried a few things, I turned on my text to speech function on my laptop to test what would be read out and this worked very well. Although with this you don’t get the full functions of the checkboxes and I was never able to add a button to preform this task. So, to be able to have this function you would have to already have the software downloaded to the machine they were using.

I also switched my contrast on my laptop as I know it helps some people to help them see better. My website and all the pages all still worked and there was nothing you couldn’t see or got altered so it was incorrect.

### Working on Different Applications

The picture you can see above are shown from a Google Chrome application but this website works on every application I could find, for example;
* Google Chrome (as seen above)
* Firefox (examples below)
* Edge
* Internet Explorer
* Safari

I hope you enjoy the website and have a good day :)
