Assignment

I have completed the Password Strength Game just need to change my if statements to now include the hue lights changing colour /void

I am still getting used to GitHub and currently when i am committing on WebStorm they arent showing up on my GitHub (probably something i am not doing) - figured it out needed to push the commits

I completely re designed my orignial Password Strength Checker for a new one as i was getting errors when i tried to add in a progress bar and checkboxes 

I've also been forgetting to commit my changes on github over christmas but trying to work on that
